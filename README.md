MDM (Max Download Manager) is a download manager that helps you to increase file download speed. 
MDM is built based on XDM open source code, it can meet the basic needs of users such as stop, cancel, restore downloaded files... and it allows 
users to choose the number of thread before downloading the file and verifying its integrity afterwards. 
In addition, MDM has a lot of other special features as extension, interact with the file system... that I want you to detect when using it =)). 
Have fun with MDM...
